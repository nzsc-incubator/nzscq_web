# Exercise 1: Rock Paper Scissors

To learn how to play NZSCQ, let's play Rock Paper Scissors. You may be consfused, given Rock Paper Scissors may seem as relevant to NZSCQ as waxing cars is to learning karate. Don't worry. In ten minutes, this will all make sense.

To introduce you to new NZSCQ concepts, you'll play a game you are probably familiar with: Rock Paper Scissors.

Just like NZSCQ, the object of this exercise is to reduce your opponent's health to zero. You deal damage to your opponent by choosing a _move_ to play against your opponent. In Rock Paper Scissors, you have three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
